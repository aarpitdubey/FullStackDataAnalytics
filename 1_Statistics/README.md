Example : Let say there are 20 classrooms in a university and you have collected the age of students in one classroom,

Ages = { 21, 20, 18, 34, 17, 22, 24, 25, 26, 23, 22 }


**Descriptive Stats** questions should be :

Q. What is the  average age of the Students in the classroom?

- Minimum age of students
- Outliers
- Distribution of the students age.
- Transformation
- Maximum Age of students.

**Inferential Stats** questions should be :

Q. Are the average Age of the student in the classroom equal to the average average ages of the entire university
